### 1. TCP Connection Establishment

The TCP connection between the client and server in all three implementations follows a similar pattern:

- **Server**: The server listens for incoming connections on a specified port (`localhost:8080`). This is done by calling `net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")`, which prepares the server to accept connections over TCP. When a client attempts to connect, `listener.Accept()` blocks until a connection request arrives. After accepting the connection, the server hands it off to a `net.Conn` object, which allows communication with the client through the TCP socket.

- **Client**: The client establishes the connection using `net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:8080")`, which sends a connection request to the server at the specified address. Upon acceptance by the server, a TCP connection is formed, allowing bidirectional communication between client and server over the same socket.

### 2. Handling Multiple Clients

In a multi-client scenario, the server faces a significant challenge in managing numerous concurrent connections. Without proper concurrency, the server would process each connection one at a time, blocking others until it finishes with the current client. This is inefficient and slows down performance, especially with many clients.

- **Concurrency in Go**: Go’s concurrency model, based on goroutines, offers a lightweight way to manage multiple clients simultaneously. In each server implementation, the server spawns a new goroutine to handle each client immediately after accepting a connection: `go handleClient(conn)`. This approach allows the server to handle multiple clients without waiting for one connection to finish before moving on to the next. Each client operates independently, as goroutines execute concurrently within the same address space, minimizing resource overhead and maximizing responsiveness.

### 3. Task Assignment to Clients

In each version of the server, tasks are assigned to the clients as follows:

- **Server-Side Task Generation**: The server generates tasks (in this case, numbers) which it then sends to each connected client over their individual connections.
- **Client-Side Task Processing**: The client receives the task, performs a calculation (e.g., squaring the number), and sends the result back to the server. The server then reads the response and processes or logs it as needed.

This process models a **"distributed work model"** where a central server assigns units of work to various workers (clients) that operate independently. Each client receives a unique task, performs computation, and returns the result.

### 4. Real-World Distributed Systems Analogy

This client-server model closely resembles **Master-Worker or Job-Worker architectures**, commonly seen in distributed systems for load balancing and parallel processing. Here are a few real-world examples:

- **MapReduce Frameworks**: In systems like Hadoop or Google’s MapReduce, a master node divides a large data processing task into smaller sub-tasks and distributes them across multiple worker nodes. Each worker node processes its assigned sub-task and returns the result to the master node.
- **Load Balancing for Web Servers**: Load balancers distribute requests across multiple web servers to handle incoming client requests concurrently. This setup is especially common in systems designed to handle a high volume of requests without overloading a single server.
